    I have also gained knowledge in Adobe Acrobat and Jotform and have worked with diffrent forms and PDF related issues. Currently i am

    Coming to the web development, seeing the growth in IT sector i realised that i should gain some knowledge in different IT realted skills,
    1st i tried data analysis but got bored as the whole process felt very monotonous then some of my friends suggested me to look into web
    development as it's a creative field and so i decided to go on with this, till now i have completed the HTML part and am enjoying it, facing
    issues and trying to understand as much as i can. I will not say i am very good but i try. As the AI is effecting most of the fields i need to
    integrate AI in this and try to improve and be creative with my approch.
